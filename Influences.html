    <h1> WorldGrower Influences</h1>
    <br>
    <h2> D&amp;D</h2>
    <a href="www.wizards.com/dnd/"> Dungeons&amp;Dragons</a> is an
    obvious influence because of the 6 character stats:<br>
    Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom and
    Charisma.<br>
    <br>
    Many spells like enlarge, reduce, disguise self, minor illusion,
    mend, etc all find their roots in D&amp;D.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2> Elder scrolls</h2>
    <br>
    The <a href="http://www.elderscrolls.com/">Elder Scrolls</a> series
    have produced great games like Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim.<br>
    The skill system in which a skill improves the more you use it is
    the same as in the Elder Scrolls.<br>
    <br>
    Using energy to cast spells is another aspect of the Elder Scrolls.<br>
    It's an open-ended sandbox world in which the player is free to
    choose what to do.<br>
    <br>
    The equipment slots and equipment that gets damaged are from
    Morrowind.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>The Sims</h2>
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.thesims.com/">The Sims</a> series is responsible
    for the energy, food and water stats.<br>
    Many dialogue options are inspired by The Sims:<br>
    For example: diplomacy options like flattery, kissing, having sex,
    talking about subjects, etc.<br>
    <br>
    The concept of relationships and family also finds its roots in The
    Sims.<br>
